CleverCogs Project â€“ Group 4

The project data is taken from a service called CleverCogs, a customisable entertainment and services system provided by Blackwood in its accommodation and externally. Blackwood provides housing and care to people with disabilities and other specific housing needs. CleverCogs is provided as a free service to any Blackwood client who recieves a care service. 

Through a tablet device, CleverCogs allows residents to access the internet and entertainment, but also specific services offered by Blackwood such as care notes or assistance.
The aim of this project is to look for correlations between the type of content that users access, and their age, location and condition etc. This might allow Blackwood to present users with activities that others with similar demographics have enjoyed, or offer suggested links.

This user data reflects the lifestyles of the people living with Blackwood - their daily routines, wake, sleep and meal times, their preferred entertainment, their favourite football teams or the kind of music they like.  Understanding how people use CleverCogs will allow Blackwood to improve the system and offer a better user experience, potentially improving quality of life within Blackwood homes.
