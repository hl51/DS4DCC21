CleverCogs Project â€“ Group 6

The project data is taken from a service called CleverCogs, a customisable entertainment and services system provided by Blackwood in its accommodation and externally. Blackwood provides housing and care to people with disabilities and other specific housing needs.

Through a tablet device, CleverCogs allows residents to access the internet and entertainment, but also specific services offered by Blackwood such as care notes or assistance.
The aim of this project is to look for correlations between the type of content that users access, and their age, location and condition etc. This might allow Blackwood to present users with activities that others with similar demographics have enjoyed, or offer suggested links.
